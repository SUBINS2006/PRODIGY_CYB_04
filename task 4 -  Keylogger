# 🛡️ Keylogger using Python

This is a simple **Keylogger** built using Python and the `pynput` library.  
It records every keystroke typed on the keyboard — across any application — and logs it into a timestamped `.txt` file.

## 📌 Features

- Records all keystrokes (letters, numbers, special keys)
- Saves logs with timestamp to a text file
- Works in the background
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
